Crystal Collector Homework by Cara Felise


This Crystal Collector game's goal is to reach the computer pick number by clicking the jewels/crystals. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the computer pick number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using jQuery, some HTML and CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@carafelise.com. I maintain and developed this project.
